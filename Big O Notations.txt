Big O Notations
=======================
Rules to follow:
-> Different steps get added.
-> Drop the constants (ex. O(2n) = O(n))
-> Different inputs => Different variables (ex. if 2 arrays (a and b) are involved, then use O(a*b) for example)
-> Drop non-dominant terms.

Note:
-> n in O(n) is only a variable, any letter will do.
