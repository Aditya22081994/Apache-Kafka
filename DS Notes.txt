Dynamic Array: 
-> The implementation in Java is ArrayList.
-> A static array with set size is formed initially.
-> If the elements are added and the array is filled to it's maximum capacity, then a new array is formed with double the size of old array.
-> The contents of old array are copied to new array.
-> The old array is removed and the pointer is moved to the new array which now has double the capacity of the old array.

Amortized Analysis:
-> Aggregate Method (brute-force sum)
-> Banker's Method (tokens)
-> Physicist's Method (potential function, Φ)
Note: Nothing changes in the code, only runtime analysis
