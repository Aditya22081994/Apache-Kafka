AGGREGATE OPERATIONS IN JAVA STREAMS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes: 
-> An aggregate opertion performs a behaviour on elements in a stream.
-> Some aggregate operations perform behaviour on all elements in a stream. (Run-to-Completion Operations)
-> Other aggregate operations perform behaviour on some elements in a stream. (Short-Circuted Operations)
-> The output of one aggregate operations can be input into the next aggregate operation in the stream.

Intermediate Operations:

Terminal Operations:



Notes:
-> Java Streams supports pipelining of aggregate operations via "fluent_interfaces".
-> Java Streams iterate internally (& invisibly) between aggregate operations.
-> Internal iterations enhances opurtunities  for transparent optimization & incurs fewer accidental complexities.
